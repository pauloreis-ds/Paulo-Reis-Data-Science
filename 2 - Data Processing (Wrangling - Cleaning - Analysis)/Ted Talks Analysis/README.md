### Lessons from this mini-project:
    1. Consider the limitations and biases of your data when analyzing it.
    2. Make your results understandable.
    
    1. Choose your plot type based on the question you are answering and the data type(s) you are working with
    2. Try modifying the plot defaults
    3. Creating plots involves decision-making (because you can't show everything)

    1. Read the documentation
    2. Use the datetime data type for dates and times
    3. Check your work as you go
    4. Consider excluding data if it might not be relevant
