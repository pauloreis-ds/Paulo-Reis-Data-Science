### Remember
This process involves manipulating data to produce relevant information. 

The point is: the most important part of this whole process is the questions we want to answer.
The business issue that is being understood. What problem are we solving and how can this data solve all this mystery.

This mentality guides us through the collection, organization / manipulation and analysis of data, so in the end we'll have a magical action to solve almost all problems.
