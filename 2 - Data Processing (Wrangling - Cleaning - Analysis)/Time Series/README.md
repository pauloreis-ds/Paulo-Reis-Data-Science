# Introduction to Time Series.
 
 Basic approach using "pseudo data" on "electricity consumption" and a "railway company".

    Agenda
        1 - Primary analysis
        2 - Visualizing the time series
        3 - How to decompose a time series into its components
        4 - Exploratory Analysis and Feature Extraction
            Hypotheses:
                People travel more during the week.
                There are peak times because of the commutes for work.
                There are periods of the month when the demand for transport is highest.


Time series analysis is an important tool in understanding the market and formulating action plans and strategies. The history of a variable can be used to identify periods of growth / decrease, seasonality and also to "predict" future observations.

Time series models are widely used to assess the behavior of a variable over time.

In fact, statistical models for time series use the variable's historical past to, as already said, project future observations. Thus, it is possible to have an idea, on average, of how the variable will behave in the coming periods.
