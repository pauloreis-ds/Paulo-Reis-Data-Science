# Sales Analysis

Video I had used to help me in this study: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMOA1pPVUc4&list=WL&index=12


    Here We'll analyze a section of 'Imaginary' E-commerce.
    There will be simple analysis and a little more complex ones.
        
    We'll basically:
        Make a question.
        Prepare data to respond it
        And analyze to get a sensible information that answers the question.

## Agenda 
    1 - Data Exploration
    2 - Data analysis
        2.1 What was the best month for sales? How much was earned that month?Â¶
            Clean up the data
            Now, We can finally find out the answer to the first question.
            Charts.
        2.2 What city had the highest number of sales?
        2.3 What time should we display advertisements to maximize likelihood of customer's buying product?
        2.4 What products are most often sold together?
        2.5 What product sold the most?
