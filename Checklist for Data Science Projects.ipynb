    "# Checklist for Data Science Projects\n",
    "\n",
    "Checklist to apply to your data science projects. Based on CRISP-DM structures and methodology proposed by Aurélien Géron, this is a routine that fits most of data science projects.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember that it is not a rigid or immutable checklist. On the contrary!\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a guide for you to not start from scratch. You can (and should) adapt your reality when working on a Data Science project.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1 - Understand the Problem\n",
    "- Look at the whole and define the scope of the project\n",
    "- What are the existing solutions?\n",
    "- How will the solution be used?\n",
    "- Which approach to use?\n",
    "    - Supervised Learning\n",
    "    - Unsupervised Learning\n",
    "    - Reinforcement Learning\n",
    "- What is the performance metric?\n",
    "- What is the minimum performance expected to achieve the goal?\n",
    "- List the basic premises of the project\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2 - Explore the Data\n",
    "- Create a copy of the data for the exploration\n",
    "- Create a Jupyter Notebook to document exploration\n",
    "- Study each attribute and its characteristics:\n",
    "    - Name\n",
    "    - Type\n",
    "        - Categorical\n",
    "        - Numeric\n",
    "            - int\n",
    "            - float\n",
    "        - Structured\n",
    "        - Unstructured\n",
    "        - etc\n",
    "    - % of missing values\n",
    "    - Noise in the data and type of noise (outliers, stochastics, rounding errors)\n",
    "    - Distribution type\n",
    "        - Gaussian\n",
    "        - Uniform\n",
    "        - Logarithmic\n",
    "        - etc\n",
    "- Identify the target variable\n",
    "- View the data\n",
    "- Study the correlation between data\n",
    "- Identify the transformations that can be applied\n",
    "- Identify extra data that may be useful\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3 - Prepare the Data\n",
    "- Working on copies of the data\n",
    "- Write functions for all transformations\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - 1.Data Cleaning\n",
    "        -Repair or remove outliers\n",
    "        -Fill in missing values or delete rows / columns\n",
    "         - Zero\n",
    "         - Average\n",
    "         - Median\n",
    "         - etc\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - 2.Attribute selection\n",
    "         - Eliminate attributes (features) that do not contain useful information\n",
    "\n",
    "    - 3.Feature Engineering\n",
    "        - Discrete continuous variables\n",
    "        - Decompose features (categorical, date, time)\n",
    "        - Apply transformations to variables\n",
    "        - Aggregate features to generate new\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - 4.Feature Scaling\n",
    "        - Normalize or standardize features\n",
    "        \n",
    "### 4. Model Construction\n",
    "- Automate as many steps as possible\n",
    "- Train more than one model and compare performances\n",
    "- Analyze the most significant variables for each algorithm\n",
    "- Fine-Tune of hyperparameters\n",
    "- Use of cross-validation\n",
    "- Check the performance of Ensemble methods, combining the models that had the best individual performances\n",
    "- Test its performance with the test dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Presentation of the Solution and Deploy\n",
    "- Document all steps\n",
    "- Make all steps replicable (download files, use the Kaggle API)\n",
    "- Remember Storytelling\n",
    "    - Decision makers and directors are probably unaware of the technical part\n",
    "- See the best chart to count each insight discovered\n",
    "- Write unit tests\n",
    "- Create monitoring routines and alerts\n",
    "- Determine when to update the model"
