# Web Scraping HuberTiming website
    This is an overview about how to web scrape, pretty simple, we'll basically
    Load the 'document' (html)
    Parse it (well, not really, you must inspect the webpage to that)
    Extract it
    and transform it into a dataset

It was a good exercise, I can see now that web scraping is not the monster I thought It was.
